The dataset link provid points to Uber data (uber_data.csv) rather than TLC trip record data. The TLC trip record data is specific to New York City's yellow and green taxi trip records.
Nonetheless, the TLC trip record data is a valuable dataset containing information about taxi trips in New York City, and it can be used for various data analysis and insights. 
The data dictionary you mentioned (data_dictionary_trip_records_yellow.pdf) should provide a detailed explanation of the fields present in the TLC trip record dataset.
For anyone interested in exploring the TLC trip record data, the official website of the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission 
(https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page) should be a useful resource. It likely provides access to the official datasets and additional information about data usage policies.
